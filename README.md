	•	Categorize Expenses: Expenses can be categorized (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
	•	Track Monthly Budget: Users can set a monthly budget and track their spending against it.
	•	Save and Load Expenses: The tracker can save expenses to a file and load them for future reference.
2.1	Technologies and Tools Used
	•	Programming Language: Python 3.13
2.2	System Architecture and Design
	The system architecture for the Personal Expense Tracker can be designed as follows:
	1.	User Interface: A simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
	2.	Expense Management Module: Handles logging, categorizing, and tracking expenses.
	3.	File Management Module: Manages saving and loading expenses from a file.
	4.	Budget Management Module: Tracks spending against the monthly budget.
2.3	Suggested Design
	•	User Interface:
	•	Input: Users can enter expenses, categories, and budget.
	•	Output: Display logged expenses, categorized expenses, and budget status.
	•	Expense Management Module:

	•	File Management Module:
	•	Functions: save_expenses(), load_expenses()
	•	Budget Management Module:
	•	Functions: set_budget(), track_budget()
3.	Installation and Setup Instructions
	1.	Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.
	2.	Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub (or any other source).
	3.	Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
	4.	Run the Application: Execute the main Python file to start the expense tracker.
4.	Usage Guidelines
	1.	Logging Expenses: Use the log_expense() function to input daily expenses.
	2.	Categorizing Expenses: Use the categorize_expense() function to assign categories to expenses.
	3.	Tracking Budget: Use the set_budget() function to set a monthly budget and track spending with track_budget().
	4.	Saving and Loading Data: Use save_expenses() to save expenses to a file and load_expenses() to load them.
